# Layers 
Layers designed for studying the following methods
1. Stochastic regularization using dropout with randomized values
2. Label smoothing to enhance generalization through softâ€‘target training
3. Feature splitting to isolate and process positive vs. negative activations
4. Integration of sinusoidal signals in generative modeling architectures
5. Application of ensemble strategies by increasing classifier diversity
